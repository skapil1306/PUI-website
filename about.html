                <p>I am a student at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing a Master's degree in 
                Human-Computer Interaction. I am interested in designing intuitive and aesthetic user
                experiences by combining concepts from cognitive science, visual design, computer science, and business. I am passionate about human-centered design and sustainable development.</p>

                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>I am currently exploring human perception of virtual home spaces at CMU's OH!Lab. Before this, I worked as a Research Assistant at UC San Diego's design lab in the Automation project. I conducted field experiments on the interaction between pedestrians and autonomous cars by observing and recording how pedestrians react to cars driven by a driver in a seat-suit or a "ghost driver." I then analyzed and annotated the video data.</p>

                <h3>Visual Design</h3>
                <p>I worked as a Design Intern for Take Her Back, a non-profit organizations that
                    rescues children from brothels all over the world. I designed the logo for the organization and designed their <a href="http://www.takeherback.org/">website</a> according to their unique mission. I also designed sponsorship kits for the organization that helped in raising money for their social work. I like to create illustrations and typographic explorations.</p>

                <h3>Entrepreneurial</h3>
                <p>I worked as the Design Lead for People Co., a startup in Cupertino, CA. As the designer, I conducted user interviews to find existing needs and breakdowns that employees in the retail industry face. I then designed an application that would help retail employees manage their schedules in a better way while also getting involved in the gig economy. I was also a part of a startup team at UCSD's Rady School of Management and we created ways for swimmers to time themselves while in water.</p>
